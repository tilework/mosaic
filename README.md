## What

#### 🧞‍♂️ Plugins

#### 🦾 Overrides

## Why

#### 🥷🏼 Make your application extensible

By using PlugJS plugins, you may make any part of your project extensible and modifiable either from within the application itself or from installed PlugJS modules.

#### ✨ Use granular micro-frontend architecture

Make dependencies injected instead of importing them! This way, you keep ALL the logic related to the module WITHIN the module, even its use cases!

#### 🎨 Theming

Build your project by overriding an existing project's functionality! Have infinite amount of parent projects. Similar to straight up forking, but with actual core updating potential. 

#### 🤝 Integrations with existing technologies

No manual configuration tinkering required, we got you covered 🤝

There are several ways on how to get PlugJS in your application - we support Next.js, create-react-app, and simple Webpack installation. Some other technologies are coming soon, stay tuned 😎
